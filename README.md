  ## Description
  
  This project is a Node.js command-line application that takes user input to create a logo and save it as a new SVG file. The application asks for the user to choose the shape color, text (up to three characters), and the text color. For this project I used Jest for running unit tests and Inquirer for collecting user input. I also strengthened my knowledge in parent and child classes and inheritence, as well as the render method.
